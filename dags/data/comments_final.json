(the other option was using pipx but it had some other errors so I had to give up on that) afterwards I made sure that I installed all the dependencies on the virtual environment as well, then I edited the inbound rules to make sure I select all traffic -  my IP and all traffic - anywhere ipv4, it did not work.

One small question. Sorry it's not related to DE but ETL. Do I need know ETL for a data analyst jobs in India ?

I don't know what is the ground reality of Data Analyst jobs in India but things like those make me scare away from applying to DA jobs in the country until I get ETL knowledge(my brain tells me that). Now I don't know heck about ETL because my professional Certification did not cover ETL so I am unable to freely apply for jobs and feel chained due to not knowing that one ETL technology.
